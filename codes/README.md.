In training, the original ipnyb files were utilized without changing much. In the first training stage, indicated by the file dsps_main_trainstep 1 the original
labeled data from training batch one was utilized. Results obtained from this first training stage were utilized for the training stage 2.

The second training stage, indicated by the code file dsps_main_trainstep_2 was utilized. The labeled data in the directory in this repository labeled as data
was added to the td4 data and the model trained using last weights from the previous training stage labeled as 
"/content/drive/MyDrive/competition/DSPS/weights/train/exp2/weights/last.pt" which might be different when run in a different machine. The model was trained for 4
